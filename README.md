## About
Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) is an EMBASSY (EMBOSS associated software) package for accessing popular bioinformatics web services. As an EMBOSS package, KBWS can be accessed from a number of graphical user interfaces, including EMBOSS Explorer, JEMBOSS, and wEMBOSS.

SOAP interface provides language-independent access to 42 bioinformatics analysis programs. The WSDL file contains descriptions for all available programs in a single file, and can be readily loaded in Taverna 2 workbench to integrate with other services to construct workflows. [Example workflows](http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1477.html) are available at the [myExperiment](http://www.myexperiment.org) website.

REST interface provides RESTful URL-based access to all analysis programs of KBWS. Here all anallysis resource can be accessed through HTTP GET/POST request.

## Usage
In this service, all methods require fasta format sequence data named as 'in0'.

### SOAP interface
Users are able to connect to this service via SOAP 1.1 (RPC/Encoded and Document/Literal).

#### Sample scripts
- [Sample codes for accessing via SOAP interface](http://www.g-language.org/wiki/kbws) (Perl, Ruby, Python, Java)
   - [RPC/Encoded](http://www.g-language.org/wiki/kbws#rpc_encoded)
   - [Document/Literal](http://www.g-language.org/wiki/kbws#documentliteral)

#### Taverna workflow
Sample workflow for Taverna 2 is available from [here](http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1477.html).

### REST interface
User are able to access to REST interface through HTTP GET/POST methods.

Available method list is [here](http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/rest/methodlist).

#### Sample script (Perl)

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use LWP::Simple;
    use LWP::UserAgent;

    my $ua= LWP::UserAgent->new();
    my %param= (in0 => $seq);

    my $response= $ua->post('http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/rest/weblogo', \%param);

    my $jobid= $response->content();

    if ($jobid) {
        print "My Jobid is ",$jobid,"\n";
    } else {
        die "Failed calling ".$param{query}.". Server returns undefined jobid ($jobid)\n";
    }

    my $pollstar= 0;
    while (get('http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/rest/checkStatus/'.$jobid) == 0) {
        print '*';
        sleep 3;
    }
    print "\n" if $pollstar;

    print get('http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/rest/getResult/'.$jobid);
